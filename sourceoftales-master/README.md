This game initially started as our entry for the Liberated Pixel Cup 2012.
(see http://lpc.opengameart.org)
Back then it was called 'Lurking Patrol Comrades'
It is a massive multiplayer online roleplay game.

Starting the game
======
We are using manasource technology as our engine, so you need to install
the mana client.

Currently, playing the game is only possible with our modded client. See the [wiki](https://github.com/tales/sourceoftales/wiki/Installation-of-client) for install instructions.

Once you have the mana client installed,
connect to server testing.manasource.org with server type ManaServ at Port
9601.

There you go.

It is recommended to get in contact first rather than creating content first.
